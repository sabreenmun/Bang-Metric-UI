# Bang Metric UI

This is a user interface for the **Bang Metric** system, which implements function primitives based on **Demarco's Bang Function**. The UI allows users to input token counts for each function primitive, then computes and displays the final score based on these inputs and DeMarco's pre-set token weights.

## Features
- **Token Weight and Function Prmimitive Input**: Users can input values for and token count and choose the function primitives.
- **Score Calculation**: Automatically calculates the score based on the inputs.
- **Interactive UI**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a simple and user-friendly interface.
